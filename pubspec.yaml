  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - assets/
   - assets/images/
   - assets/images/main/
   - assets/images/launcher/
   - assets/images/switch/
   - assets/fonts/ 
   - assets/lotiee/
   - assets/images/lottie/

  fonts:
    - family: keep
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/keep.ttf
    - family: transformers
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/transformers.ttf
    - family: truelies
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/truelies.ttf
    - family: modern

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
